    <h3>On Passing Time</h3>
    <p>A title like that sounds like one of those treaties written by those old Greeks, it always went like on and then whatever they were talking about. In that aspect they were not very creative. I think most people today when they have to pass the time they immediately jump on their computers. While I don't condone this per se, I don't think there is some moral advantage for those that don't. Then the four main types of entertainment seem to be social media, youtube, video games, and tv.</p>
    <h3>YouTube</h3>
    <p>I think snoozing through hours of YouTube videos is one of the most brain dead activities that one can partake in. Nonetheless I was very guilty of this up until around the middle of eighth grade, I used to watch hours upon hours of idiotic videos. Don't do this. </p>
    <h3>Social Media</h3>
    <p>The only quality conversations I find online are on Snapchat, Instagram, and forums dedicated to some niche. The only one I ever use is that second one, though I never actually post. Since it is sacrilegious to talk about sites such as that, I won't list them. Discover them for yourself.</p>
    <h3>T.V.</h3>
    <p>I never really watch television, so I have no idea what's good. This only show I've watched in the past six months is Serial Experiment Lain, watch that. Also, Come and See, which that ending scene where the girl walked out of the woods with ONLY a tattered dress with blood dripping down her legs was, I can't really describe it. It's a graphic movie about the eastern front of WW2. Then also Gettysburg, another good movie. All of them were great, watch them if you're in to that kind of stuff.</p>
